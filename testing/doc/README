How to run test scripts for Armor Tools
=======================================

Tested Distributions: Open-Estuary ARM64 - Ubuntu, Fedora and OpenSuse.

1) Download the Armor project files from open-estuary repo either on host machine or on D02 board
   git clone https://github.com/open-estuary/armor

2) Copy testing/test_scripts folder to your NFS for D02 board
   OR
   On the shell terminal, go to testing/test_scripts folder if you downloaded on D02 board

3) To test individual tools please run on the shell terminal
    'sh test_<tool's name>.sh' -> for test armor tools.  
    For example, 'sh test_strace.sh'
    The test results can be seen on the console. 

4) run command 'sh auto_test_armor_tools.sh' 
   This script will run the basic tests for the list of tools supported in Armor releases.

5) For the tools those are not already present in the open-estuary distribution and
   if the tools are available as package in the distribution repo, 
   then tools are installed from package using the installation commands added in the open-estuary/estuary/post_install.sh script.
 
   Note 1: The following steps must be done for the successful Armor tool's package installation using the post_install.sh script.  
   Ubuntu: please update /etc/apt/sources.list file in the rfs with the right ubuntu repo paths and run 'apt-get update' command.
   Fedora: run 'dnf update' command.
   OpenSuse: run 'zypper update' command.  

   Note 2: By default Armor tool's package installation using the post_install.sh script is disabled. 
            To enable please uncomment the line INSTALL_ARMOR_TOOLS="ON".  
  
6) If the tools are not present either in distribution or as package, 
   then the tools binary built from source might added in 
   https://github.com/open-estuary/armor/tree/master/testing/binary and can be installed.

   Binaries created in either .deb format for Ubuntu or in .rpm format for Fedora and OpenSuse or 
   as arm64 executable which can directly run.
